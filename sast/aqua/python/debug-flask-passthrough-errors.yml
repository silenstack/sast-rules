    message: The application is running debug code or has debug mode enabled. This
      may expose sensitive information, like stack traces and environment
      variables, to attackers. It may also modify application behavior,
      potentially enabling attackers to bypass restrictions. To remediate this
      finding, ensure that the application's debug code and debug mode are
      disabled or removed from the production environment.
